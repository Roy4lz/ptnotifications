-	Start a chat with your bot's name (for example ​@MyTPBot) and press start button ​
-	Start another ​chat with [https://t.me/MyTelegramID_bot.]([https://t.me/MyTelegramID_bot)
-	If that doesn't work, try a chat with [https://​telegram.me/​id_chatbot.](https://​telegram.me/​id_chatbot)
or paste @id_chatbot into a telegram chat and click it. It should open the chat id bot in a new chat.
or send a message to: @userinfobot with content: /start

#### Quick notes to success
- to get the "discord_channel_id =" please go to Discord settings > appearence > developer mode on then right click on the channel you want the bot in and click Copy ID - this will be a number please use this and not the channel name or it will say bot token error

###### Prepare your ProfitTrailer instances
- Give every ProfitTrailer instance you run a unique ```server.sitename``` in the ```application.properties``` file. This is so it's easier to recognize your bots easier when receiving notifications.
- Read note above Make sure to set the ```server.api_token``` variable in the ```application.properties``` file for each instance as well. This value can be any random arrangement of characters. This is needed so the addon can request access to the trade data. 
- MAKE SURE TO RESTART PT AFTER EDITING PT BEFORE STARTING!
